Git 2.32 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

 * ".gitattributes", ".gitignore", and ".mailmap" files that are
   symbolic links are ignored.


Updates since v2.32
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * It does not make sense to make ".gitattributes", ".gitignore" and
   ".mailmap" symlinks, as they are supposed to be usable from the
   object store (think: bare repositories where HEAD:.mailmap etc. are
   used).  When these files are symbolic links, we used to read the
   contents of the files pointed by them by mistake, which has been
   corrected.

 * "git stash show" learned to optionally show untracked part of the
   stash.

 * "git log --format='...'" learned "%(describe)" placeholder.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Rename detection rework continues.


Fixes since v2.31
-----------------

 * The fsmonitor interface read from its input without making sure
   there is something to read from.  This bug is new in 2.31
   timeframe.
   (merge 097ea2c848 jh/fsmonitor-prework later to maint).

 * The data structure used by fsmonitor interface was not properly
   duplicated during an in-core merge, leading to use-after-free etc.
   (merge 4abc57848d js/fsmonitor-unpack-fix later to maint).

 * "git bisect" reimplemented more in C during 2.30 timeframe did not
   take an annotated tag as a good/bad endpoint well.  This regression
   has been corrected.
   (merge 7730f85594 jk/bisect-peel-tag-fix later to maint).

 * Fix macros that can silently inject unintended null-statements.
   (merge 116affac3f rs/avoid-null-statement-after-macro-call later to maint).

 * CALLOC_ARRAY() macro replaces many uses of xcalloc().
   (merge 1c57cc70ec rs/calloc-array later to maint).

 * Update insn in Makefile comments to run fuzz-all target.
   (merge 68b5c3aa48 ah/make-fuzz-all-doc-update later to maint).

 * Fix a corner case bug in "git mv" on case insensitive systems,
   which was introduced in 2.29 timeframe.
   (merge 93c3d297b5 tb/git-mv-icase-fix later to maint).

 * We had a code to diagnose and die cleanly when a required
   clean/smudge filter is missing, but an assert before that
   unnecessarily fired, hiding the end-user facing die() message.
   (merge 6fab35f748 mt/cleanly-die-upon-missing-required-filter later to maint).

 * Update C code that sets a few configuration variables when a remote
   is configured so that it spells configuration variable names in the
   canonical camelCase.
   (merge 0f1da600e6 ab/remote-write-config-in-camel-case later to maint).

 * A new configuration variable has been introduced to allow choosing
   which version of the generation number gets used in the
   commit-graph file.
   (merge 702110aac6 ds/commit-graph-generation-config later to maint).

 * Perf test update to work better in secondary worktrees.
   (merge 36e834abc1 jk/perf-in-worktrees later to maint).

 * Updates to memory allocation code around the use of pcre2 library.
   (merge c1760352e0 ab/grep-pcre2-allocfix later to maint).

 * "git -c core.bare=false clone --bare ..." would have segfaulted,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 75555676ad bc/clone-bare-with-conflicting-config later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 486f4bd183 jc/calloc-fix later to maint).
   (merge 5f70859c15 jt/clone-unborn-head later to maint).
   (merge cfd409ed09 km/config-doc-typofix later to maint).
   (merge 8588aa8657 jk/slimmed-down later to maint).
   (merge 241b5d3ebe rs/xcalloc-takes-nelem-first later to maint).
   (merge f451960708 dl/cat-file-doc-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge 12604a8d0c sv/t9801-test-path-is-file-cleanup later to maint).
