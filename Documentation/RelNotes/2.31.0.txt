Git 2.31 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.30
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * The "--format=%(trailers)" mechanism gets enhanced to make it
   easier to design output for machine consumption.

 * When a user does not tell "git pull" to use rebase or merge, the
   command gives a loud message telling a user to choose between
   rebase or merge but creates a merge anyway, forcing users who would
   want to rebase to redo the operation.  Fix an early part of this
   problem by tightening the condition to give the message---there is
   no reason to stop or force the user to choose between rebase or
   merge if the history fast-forwards.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * A 3-year old test that was not testing anything useful has been
   corrected.
